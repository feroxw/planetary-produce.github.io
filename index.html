&nbsp; &nbsp; Planetary Produce is a grassroots start-up that aims to foster healthy eating habits and sustainable farming solutions.  Funded by you and for you, Planetary Produce seeks to empower local communities to grow their own safe, minimally-modified crops to feed themselves, both reducing their dependancy on produce from the Core planets and boosting the productivity of local farmers.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Founded two years ago in 2451, Planetary Produce has worked with numerous groups in the Zebes star system to educate beings on the benefits of eating local ingredients. Furthermore the organisation has hosted a number of fundraisers to support Soil Grown Alternatives, a non-profit research entity, and Kids for Krops, an education intiative for beings still in their developmental phase.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why should we care about local produce? The Zebes system is 14 light years away from the Core. On average, between 20-25% of foodstuffs arrives with radiation damage, wasting our money and making it harder for us to safely feed our dependants.  On top of that, some studies show that up to 70% of artificially grown crops lack the nutrients of their ancient kin, long forgotten in the interior. 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, Zebes is a prime location for natural, soil-grown produce. She holds several planets of diverse composition, and she receives a soil flare only twice a year. Explore the links to the left to learn more about how to change the status quo.
